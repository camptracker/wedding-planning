        <h3>🔧 DIY Option: Your Own Sound System</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speaker rental:</strong> Rent a PA system from Guitar Center Fresno or local Visalia music shops ($100-300/day). You'll need 2 powered speakers (12-15") on stands + a mixer for 100+ guests outdoors.</li>
          <li><strong>Recommended setup for 100-150 guests outdoors:</strong> 2x QSC K12.2 or JBL EON715 speakers ($75-150/each rental), 1 small mixer ($25-50 rental), 1 wireless mic for toasts ($30-50 rental). Total: ~$200-400.</li>
          <li><strong>Playlist tips:</strong> Build a 5-6 hour playlist on Spotify. Mix genres. Start mellow during dinner, build energy for dancing. Use crossfade (12 seconds) in Spotify settings for smooth transitions.</li>
          <li><strong>Cable needs:</strong> 3.5mm to dual 1/4" cable or Bluetooth adapter for connecting phone/laptop to speakers. Bring backup cables!</li>
          <li><strong>Power:</strong> Powered speakers need AC outlets. If no nearby power, rent a generator (see Essentials tab). Run extension cords safely — use cord covers to prevent trips.</li>
          <li><strong>Assign a "DJ friend":</strong> Someone to manage volume, handle the mic for toasts, and keep the playlist moving. Brief them beforehand.</li>
          <li><strong>Backup plan:</strong> Download your playlist offline — cell signal can be spotty in the Three Rivers / foothill areas near Sequoia National Park.</li>
