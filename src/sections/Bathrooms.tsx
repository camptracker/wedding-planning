        <h3>🔧 DIY Option: Bathroom Setup</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Composting toilets:</strong> Buy 2-3 composting toilet units ($150–400 each) and build simple privacy enclosures from wood/fabric. Eco-friendly but requires sawdust and emptying.</li>
          <li><strong>Existing property structures:</strong> If the property has a house/barn with plumbing, maximize those facilities. Add signage and ensure septic can handle the volume.</li>
          <li><strong>Rent-to-own trailers:</strong> Some RV/trailer rental companies offer weekend bathroom trailers. Check Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist Fresno/Visalia for deals.</li>
          <li><strong>Hand-wash stations:</strong> Build from 5-gallon water coolers with spigots, soap dispensers, and towel holders (~$30 total per station).</li>
          <li><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Whatever you choose, plan for 1 toilet per 25 guests. For a 100-person wedding, 4 units minimum. For a 150-person wedding, 6 units.</li>
          <li><strong>Three Rivers note:</strong> If the property is up in Three Rivers (closer to Sequoia), confirm delivery access — some luxury trailer companies charge extra for mountain road delivery.</li>
