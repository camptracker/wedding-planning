        A 5-acre outdoor wedding in the Visalia / Three Rivers area needs infrastructure: shelter, seating, power, parking, and permits. 
        Central Valley summers hit 100-110°F, so shade and cooling are critical for summer weddings. 
        Fall is gorgeous near Sequoia National Park with mild temps and stunning foliage.

          area to reduce noise. Consider a "whisper quiet" inverter generator ($300-500/day).

      <h2 className="category-header">🅿️ Parking</h2>

      <div className="vendor-card">
        <h3>Parking on 5 Acres</h3>
        <div className="price">Free (your property) — but plan logistics</div>
        <p className="description">
          5 acres gives you room. Designate a flat area for parking (grass works in dry weather — 
          Central Valley summers are bone dry). For 100 guests ≈ 60-70 cars, you need roughly 0.5-1 acre 
          for parking. Mark the area with signs or cones. Consider hiring 1-2 parking attendants 
          ($15-20/hr) to direct traffic. 
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Three Rivers note:</strong> If the property is on a rural road, ensure there's adequate 
          turnaround space. Mountain roads can be narrow — consider a shuttle from a Visalia parking lot 
          for larger weddings.

      <h2 className="category-header">🌡️ Heating & Cooling</h2>

      <div className="vendor-card">
        <h3>Cooling Options (Summer Weddings)</h3>
        <div className="price">$200–$800/day</div>
        <p className="description">
          Central Valley summers reach 100-110°F! Options: Large industrial fans ($50-100/day each), 
          misting systems ($150-400 rental), portable evaporative coolers ($100-200/day). 
          Best strategy: schedule ceremony for late afternoon (5-6 PM) when temps drop, 
          provide shade with tents, and have a water station. If the property is at higher 
          elevation near Three Rivers, temps may be 5-10° cooler than the valley floor.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="vendor-card">
        <h3>Heating Options (Fall/Winter Weddings)</h3>
        <div className="price">$100–$400/day</div>
        <p className="description">
          Patio heaters: $50-75/each rental (need 4-8 for reception area). 
          Propane fire pits: $100-200 rental (great ambiance + warmth). 
          Tent sidewalls: $100-300 add-on to tent rental (keeps wind out). 
          Blanket favors: Buy throw blankets in bulk ($5-8 each) as guest favors.
          Fall in the foothills near Sequoia is stunning — worth considering!

        <h3>What You Need for a Private Property Event</h3>
        <div className="price">Varies — most are free or low-cost for private events</div>
        <p className="description">
          <strong>Good news:</strong> Private events on private property in unincorporated Tulare County 
          generally don't require special event permits unless you're charging admission or it's a 
          commercial operation. However, check these:
        </p>
        <div className="description">
          <br />
          • <strong>Noise ordinance:</strong> Tulare County noise ordinance limits loud music during nighttime hours. Plan to wind down by 10 PM to be safe.<br />
          • <strong>Alcohol:</strong> No permit needed to serve alcohol at a private event (not selling). If hiring a bar service that sells drinks, they need an ABC license.<br />
          • <strong>Temporary structures:</strong> Large tents (over 400 sq ft) may require a temporary structure permit from Tulare County Resource Management Agency — call (559) 624-7000.<br />
          • <strong>Fire safety:</strong> If using open flames, fire pits, or cooking with propane, check with Tulare County Fire Department. Especially important in the foothill/Three Rivers area due to wildfire risk. Have fire extinguishers on-site. Check CAL FIRE restrictions during fire season.<br />
          • <strong>Food service:</strong> If hiring a caterer, they handle their own permits. For self-catering a private event, you're generally exempt. Contact Tulare County Health & Human Services: (559) 624-7400.<br />
          • <strong>Parking on road:</strong> If guests will park on county roads, contact Tulare County Public Works.<br />
          • <strong>Marriage license:</strong> Tulare County Clerk-Recorder's Office in Visalia — (559) 636-5050. Fee ~$90, valid 90 days.

      <div className="diy-section">
        <h3>🔧 DIY Essentials Checklist</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shade structures:</strong> Buy 10x10 pop-up canopies from Costco Visalia ($100-200 each). Get 4-6 for a reception area. Anchor with sandbags or stakes.</li>
          <li><strong>Seating:</strong> Hay bales for ceremony seating — $5-8/bale from local farms in Tulare County (tons of agricultural operations nearby!). Rustic and cheap for 100+ guests.</li>
          <li><strong>Lighting DIY:</strong> Buy commercial outdoor string lights from Amazon/Costco. Use 4x4 posts set in 5-gallon buckets of concrete as light poles ($20 each). Total for 300ft of lights + poles: ~$200-300.</li>
          <li><strong>Dance floor:</strong> Rent a portable dance floor ($300-600) or use a flat area of compacted ground/plywood sheets ($50-100 for 12x12 area).</li>
          <li><strong>Signage:</strong> Make directional signs from reclaimed wood + paint. Mark parking, ceremony, reception, restrooms, and bar areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Trash/recycling:</strong> Rent extra trash cans or buy large bins. Assign someone to manage waste. Compost food scraps.</li>
          <li><strong>First aid:</strong> Keep a first aid kit at the reception. Include sunscreen, bug spray (mosquitoes near irrigation canals!), and Advil. Consider having a cooler with cold water and electrolyte drinks — essential in Central Valley heat.</li>
