        A 5-acre outdoor wedding in Woodland needs infrastructure: shelter, seating, power, parking, and permits. 
        Woodland summers hit 95-105°F, so shade and cooling are critical if it's a summer wedding.

      <h2 className="category-header">🅿️ Parking</h2>

      <div className="vendor-card">
        <h3>Parking on 5 Acres</h3>
        <div className="price">Free (your property) — but plan logistics</div>
        <p className="description">
          5 acres gives you room. Designate a flat area for parking (grass works in dry weather — 
          Woodland summers are dry). For 100 guests ≈ 60-70 cars, you need roughly 0.5-1 acre 
          for parking. Mark the area with signs or cones. Consider hiring 1-2 parking attendants 
          ($15-20/hr) to direct traffic. For wet-season weddings: lay down gravel or rent 
          temporary road mats ($200-500).

          Woodland summers reach 95-105°F. Options: Large industrial fans ($50-100/day each), 
          misting systems ($150-400 rental), portable evaporative coolers ($100-200/day).

          provide shade with tents, and have a water station.

        <h3>What You Need for a Private Property Event</h3>
        <div className="price">Varies — most are free or low-cost for private events</div>
        <p className="description">
          <strong>Good news:</strong> Private events on private property in unincorporated Yolo County 
          generally don't require special event permits unless you're charging admission or it's a 
          commercial operation. However, check these:
        </p>
        <div className="description">
          <br />
          • <strong>Noise ordinance:</strong> Yolo County noise ordinance limits loud music after 10 PM. Plan accordingly.<br />
          • <strong>Alcohol:</strong> No permit needed to serve alcohol at a private event (not selling). If hiring a bar service that sells drinks, they need an ABC license.<br />
          • <strong>Temporary structures:</strong> Large tents (over 400 sq ft) may require a temporary structure permit from Yolo County Building Division — call (530) 666-8775.<br />
          • <strong>Fire safety:</strong> If using open flames, fire pits, or cooking with propane, check with Woodland Fire Department. Have fire extinguishers on-site.<br />
          • <strong>Food service:</strong> If hiring a caterer, they handle their own permits. For self-catering a private event, you're generally exempt. Contact Yolo County Environmental Health: (530) 666-8646.<br />
          • <strong>Parking on road:</strong> If guests will park on county roads, contact Yolo County Public Works.

        <h3>🔧 DIY Essentials Checklist</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shade structures:</strong> Buy 10x10 pop-up canopies from Costco ($100-200 each). Get 4-6 for a reception area. Anchor with sandbags or stakes.</li>
          <li><strong>Seating:</strong> Hay bales for ceremony seating — $5-8/bale from local farms in Woodland/Yolo County. Rustic and cheap for 100+ guests.</li>
          <li><strong>Lighting DIY:</strong> Buy commercial outdoor string lights from Amazon/Costco. Use 4x4 posts set in 5-gallon buckets of concrete as light poles ($20 each). Total for 300ft of lights + poles: ~$200-300.</li>
          <li><strong>Dance floor:</strong> Rent a portable dance floor ($300-600) or use a flat area of compacted ground/plywood sheets ($50-100 for 12x12 area).</li>
          <li><strong>Signage:</strong> Make directional signs from reclaimed wood + paint. Mark parking, ceremony, reception, restrooms, and bar areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Trash/recycling:</strong> Rent extra trash cans or buy large bins. Assign someone to manage waste. Compost food scraps.</li>
          <li><strong>First aid:</strong> Keep a first aid kit at the reception. Include sunscreen, bug spray, and Advil. Consider having a cooler with cold water and electrolyte drinks.</li>
