        <h3>🔧 DIY Option: Self-Catering Your Wedding</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Permits:</strong> Yolo County Environmental Health requires a Temporary Food Facility permit for events serving food to the public. For private events on private property, you may be exempt — check with Yolo County Environmental Health at (530) 666-8646.</li>
          <li><strong>Equipment rentals:</strong> Rent chafing dishes ($10-15/each), serving platters, and coolers from Celebrations Party Rentals in Sacramento.</li>
          <li><strong>Food safety:</strong> Keep hot foods above 140°F, cold foods below 40°F. Use Sterno cans for chafing dishes (~$3/can, burns 2-4 hours). Rent coolers/ice chests for cold items.</li>
          <li><strong>Costco/Smart & Final:</strong> Both have locations in Woodland. Costco party platters (feeds 16-20) run $30-60 each. Costco sheet cakes are $20-25 and feed 48.</li>
          <li><strong>Potluck style:</strong> Assign dishes to willing family/friends. Create a shared spreadsheet. Provide all serving ware and labeling for allergens.</li>
          <li><strong>Taco bar:</strong> One of the easiest DIY options. Buy pre-made carnitas/chicken from Costco, prep toppings, warm tortillas on a griddle. ~$8-12/person for excellent quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Recruit 2-3 friends to be "food coordinators" who manage setup, replenishment, and cleanup so the couple doesn't have to worry.</li>
